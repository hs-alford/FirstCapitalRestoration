# FirstCapitalRestoration
A website created for a client's carpentry business for customers to be able to view past work and contact the client. Besides the frontend of the website and a contact form, the client wanted to be able to easily edit the site themselves (change text, images, elements, etc).

The 'Contact Us' form at the bottom of the page validates input and sends an email to the client.

There is a separate admin page that the client can log into and edit the webpage's text, images, and even add images (such as, to the slideshow).
