# FirstCapitalRestoration
A website created for a client's carpentry business for customers to be able to view past work and contact the client.
'Contact Us' form at the bottom of the page validates input and sends an email to the client.
The client also wanted to be able to easily edit the page themselves (change text, images, elements, etc.), so I added a separate admin page that can they can log into and edit the webpage.
